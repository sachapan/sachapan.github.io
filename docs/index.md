_Wherein vim and git are in a committed relationship._


I use this space to record some of my thoughts.  

Perhaps others may benefit in some way, sometime, somehow.  As I have from what others have shared in their personal corner of the internet.  So much of what we communicate digitally is ethereal and fleeting.  A quick reply on Telegram or WhatsApp.  A quick post on twitter or facebook.  A forum or discord conversation.  Some ideas come to life and their whole existence is a partial sentence, or half a mangled sentence with a GIF for emphasis.  Of course, thanks to search engines some of that can be dredged up from the mire.  

Well, that got weird, what is this the lyrics to Dust in the Wind.
